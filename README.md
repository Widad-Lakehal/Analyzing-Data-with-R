# Analyzing-Data-with-R
This repository includes my projects from the Analyzing Data with R course by IBM on edX.It covers data wrangling, descriptive statistics, visualization, model development and evaluation. The projects demonstrate how to apply analytical techniques to real-world datasets and effectively build predictive models using R.
